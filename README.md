##### Importing settings from a URL

```
concfg import https://raw.github.com/lukesampson/concfg/master/presets/solarized-light.json

```
This URL happens to be one of the built in presets--it's just an example of importing a URL. The easy way to get Solarized light would be `concfg import solarized-light`
